            <p>It's hard to resist the playful antics and soft little 
                bodies of kittens. Even as they grow into adulthood,
                 cats are endearing pets and faithful companions. 
                 The ancient Egyptians worshipped cats and held them 
                 in the highest esteem. Many people who live in earthquake 
                 areas credit cats with saving their lives -- the cats' 
                 heightened senses gave them early warning and helped them 
                 escape the quake. To most of us, cats are cute 
                 because of their almond-shaped eyes, the variety of fur 
                 colors, their small noses and paws and the adorable 
                 and funny things they do that rarely fail to entertain us.

            <p>Cats love playtime and can get involved in many activities
                 -- from batting a ball to exploring the house and all its 
                 dark corners. Cats love climbing and jumping, 
                 and have an inbred sense of curiosity that will sometimes 
                 land them in hilarious situations.
